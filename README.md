## Evolutionary Plastic Artificial Neural Networks

***A Python package for implementing Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) variants for indirectly encoding artificial neural networks.***

- **Purpose:**
1. Greater understanding of the HyperNEAT algorithm and indirect encoding variants for evolving a popultion of neural networks.
2. Practice in package management 

- ** Details:**

As deep learning becomes more essential for building solutions to machine learning problems, it becomes clear that a broader definition of solution characteristics required for a kind of task is needed, such that model selection and discovery is better optimized for future problems. Likewise, as deep learning has been inspired by the study of biological nervous systems, theoretical neuroscience can benefit from this context in the development of better theories of biological neural networks.
